# How to automate version bumping for releases?

## Thesis
Two approaches: (A) setuptools-scm for tag-based versioning - cleaner, industry standard; (B) Auto-bump workflow that updates versions on release creation - quick fix, keeps current structure

## Open Questions
- Which approach fits the project better?
- Does plugin.json need special handling with setuptools-scm?
